# Flipper
This is a really small game made for [overdrive!](https://training.campfire.hackclub.com)

Basically, you're a frog stuck in an infinite loop, and every time you reach the end, you have a chance to either win or go to the flip slide (where your controls and character are also flipped)!

Hopefully this fits the theme and uh yeah enjoy

Use arrow keys to move
